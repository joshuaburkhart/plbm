For the C/C++/CUDA code, see the writeup.txt file in the cport directory.

The parallel Matlab code is in the Matlab-MPI-PCT-Jacket directory.
It includes a Matlab data file called pblm_workspace.mat that contains the 
"bootlist" result for the large dataset (plantphyno01000_3 and bactphyno01000_3).
The analysis section of the code (that shows the plots) was moved to the file, 
analyze_bootlist.m.  Note that the "dtrue" value will be different for other data-
sets.  

================================
To use the Matlab code on Aciss:
================================

1) MatlabMPI must be on your Matlab path.  I did this by creating a document 
   in my user folder:
      $ vi ~/Documents/MATLAB/startup.m
   and adding the MatlabMPI path by placing this line in startup.m:
      addpath /usr/local/packages/MatlabMPI/1.2/src/

   Make sure it works by starting Matlab and typing:
         "help MatlabMPI".  
   You should see a long list of method explanations.
   (This might be easier to do in the future, the admins are thinking of creating
    a MatlabMPI module that will do this for you).

2) Jacket must be on your path (if you have a license, or are using the trial).

   -> This is done by placing this line in that same startup.m file:
        addpath /home11/ozog/usr/local/jacket/jacket/engine

   Make sure it works by logging into an ACISS gpu node, starting Matlab and 
   typing:
        "ginfo"
   You should see something like this:
      Jacket v2.0 (build 0ae6cf5) by AccelerEyes (64-bit Linux)
      License Type: Designated Computer (/home11/ozog/usr/local/jacket/jacket/engine/jlicense.dat)
      License expires in 7 days.
      Addons: MGL16, JMC, SDK, DLA, SLA
      CUDA toolkit 4.0, driver 285.05.32
      GPU1 Tesla M2070, 5376 MB, Compute 2.0 (single,double) (in use)
      GPU2 Tesla M2070, 5376 MB, Compute 2.0 (single,double)
      GPU3 Tesla M2070, 5376 MB, Compute 2.0 (single,double)
      Memory Usage: 5306 MB free (5376 MB total)

   I don't think this will work unless you are using your own license (and it 
   definitely won't work after March 26, 2012).  I do think UO should get a 
   Jacket license, and I'm trying to convince the right people that this is a 
   good academic investment.

2) We created a PBS launch script for launching a large Matlab PBLM job across ACISS.

   -> First you must find out which nodes are available.  There is a script in the
      Matlab-MPI-PCT-Jacket directory calle "get_free_nodes".  Use this to find 
      free gpu, longgpu, or generic nodes by doing something like this:

        $ get_freenodes gpu
        $ get_freenodes longgpu
        $ get_freenodes generic 

   -> Then you must place these node names appropriately in both the launch_job.m 
      and launch_job.sh files. It should be pretty self explanatory, but let us know
      if you are using this code and having trouble with that.  You can see that 
      I tried to automate this, but it I couldn't get it working for whatever reason.
  
   -> You must also change WORK_DIR in launch_job.sh to the directory in which
      the program and data files live.

   -> launch the job by typing this:

        $ qsub -q <queue> launch_job.sh

      where <queue> is something like gpu, longgpu, fatnodes, or generic

   -> NOTE:  You don't HAVE to use the gpus and you don't HAVE to use only 3 threads
             per node.  This would involve deleting the Jacket calls in runIGfunctpar.m by
             commenting out the GPU section and uncommenting the non-GPU section. 
             Then in the Phyllosphere_Bootstrapno01000_3.m program, simply change
                    "matlabpool open 3"
             to
                    "matlabpool open <num_threads>"

             where <num_threads is something like 12 for gpu and generic nodes, 
             or 8, 16, or 32 for fatnodes. Then you need to change all the occurences of
             ":ppn=3" in launch_job.sh to ":ppn=<num_threads>" and it should work (this
             is what you would have to do with the really large dataset).


FINAL NOTE:
It's tough (if not impossible) to test how this will work from within YOUR environment, 
so issues could arise when setting up this program (especially because we are using 
external code, MatabMPI and Jacket).  Therefore, don't hesitate to ask 
us questions about using the program.
